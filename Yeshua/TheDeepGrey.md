# Cloud Security Project: The Deep Grey
Hello there~

_"It’s the week before the Year 12 Formal. Friends, family, and partners of Crabby College seek attendance… but who’s gonna contact them all? 
A guestbook website supplements this process. And a certain nerd wants to invite his pet Chihuahua through this system. 
SQL Injection within a user input field may allow insertion of additional data. If only you could find the right attack surface…"_

### The task:
- [x] Apply the Input Validation & Sanitization Process to find the Packet Tracer Flag
- [x] Traverse a files system in order to locate the right file for XSS (if only you knew what that was!)
<sub>no need to fret. you don't have to be a crabby canary to complete this challenge!</sub>
