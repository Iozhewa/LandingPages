# Cloud Security Project: The Deep Grey
Hello there~

_"It’s the week before the Year 12 Formal. Friends, family, and partners of Crabby College seek attendance… but who’s gonna contact them all? 
A guestbook website supplements this process. And a certain nerd wants to invite his pet Chihuahua through this system. 
SQL Injection within a user input field may allow insertion of additional data. If only you could find the right attack surface…"_

### The task:
- [x] Apply the Input Validation & Sanitization Process to find the Packet Tracer Flag
- [x] Traverse a files system in order to locate the right file for XSS (if only you knew what that was!)
<sub>no need to fret. you don't have to be a crabby canary to complete this challenge!</sub>

## First: Packet POV

Aw. Look at you. Sweet bundle of data. Created from controlled subparticle drift to signal machines at near
lightspeed. Adorable, waddling bits of bytes.

WOAH
That's a huge path! Be careful there -- some gateways may be closed, some computers may react badly to your signals...
so many risks at hand!

This thing in the middle is the crux of this Local Area Network: `The Router`. The end-devices (Desktops and Laptops) access applications from the servers in isolation because of it. For our packet friend, _Packiceetus_, it's the biggest roundabout in the world.
Double click the router to optimize his route.

That's real technical, so let's have fun with it. Try some commands, much like asking the bus driver for directions.
Just... always thank your bus drivers. Start with
```
Router>
Router> enable
Router#
Router# show ip int brief
```
